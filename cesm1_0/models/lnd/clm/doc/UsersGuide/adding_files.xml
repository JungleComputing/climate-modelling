<title>Adding New Resolutions or New Files to the build-namelist Database</title>
<para>
In the last chapter we gave the details on how to create new files for input into
CLM. These files could be either global resolutions, regional-grids or even a single
grid point. If you want to easily have these files available for continued use in your
development you will then want to include them in the build-namelist database so
that build-namelist can easily find them for you. You can deal with them, just by
editing your namelist by hand (or using a &usernlclm; namelist file), or by using
&CLMUSRDAT;. Another way to deal with them is to enter them into
the database for build-namelist, so that build-namelist can find them for you.
This keeps one central database for all your files, rather than having multiple locations
to keep track of files. If you have a LOT of files to keep track of it also might
be easier than keeping track by hand, especially if you have to periodically update
your files. If you just have a few quick experiments to try, for a short time period
you might be best off using the other methods mentioned above.
</para>
<para>
There are two parts to adding files to the build-namelist database. The first part
is adding new resolution names which is done in the
<filename>models/lnd/clm/bld/namelist_files/namelist_definition.xml</filename> file.
The second part is actually adding the new filenames which is done in the 
<filename>models/lnd/clm/bld/namelist_files/namelist_defaults_clm.xml</filename> file.
If you aren't adding any new resolutions, and you are just changing the files for existing
resolutions, you don't need to edit the namelist_definition file.
</para>
<sect1 id="adding_resolutions">
<title>Adding Resolution Names</title>
<para>
If you are adding files for new resolutions which aren't covered in the
namelist_definition file -- you'll need to add them in. The list of valid resolutions
is in the id="res" entry in the
<filename>models/lnd/clm/bld/namelist_files/namelist_definition.xml</filename> file.
You need to choose a name for your new resolution and simply add it to the comma
delimited
list of valid_values for the id="res" entry. The convention for global Gaussian grids
is number_of_latitudes x number_of_longitudes. The convention for global finite
volume grids is latitude_grid_size x longitude_grid_size where latitude and longitude
is measured in degrees. For regional or single-point datasets the names have a grid size
number_of_latitudes x number_of_longitudes followed by an underscore and then a 
descriptive name such as a City name followed by an abbreviation for the Country in caps. 
The only hard requirement is that names be unique for different grid files.
Here's what the entry for resolutions looks like in the file:
<screen width="99">
&lt;entry id="res" type="char*30" category="default_settings"
       group="default_settings"  
       valid_values=
"128x256,64x128,48x96,32x64,8x16,94x192,0.23x0.31,0.47x0.63,
0.9x1.25,1.9x2.5,2.65x3.33,4x5,10x15,5x5_amazon,1x1_tropicAtl,
1x1_camdenNJ,1x1_vancouverCAN,1x1_mexicocityMEX,1x1_asphaltjungleNJ,
1x1_brazil,1x1_urbanc_alpha,0.5x0.5"&gt;
Horizontal resolutions
&lt;/entry&gt;
</screen>
As you can see you just add your new resolution names to the end of the valid_values
list.
</para>
</sect1>

<sect1 id="adding_default_files">
<title>Adding or Changing Default Filenames</title>
<para>
To add or change the default filenames you edit the
<filename>models/lnd/clm/bld/namelist_files/namelist_defaults_clm.xml</filename>
and either change an existing filename or add a new one. Most entries in the
default namelist files, include different attributes that describe the different
properties that describe the differences in the datasets. Attributes include 
the: resolution, year to simulation, range of years to simulate for transient
datafiles, the land-mask, the representative concentration pathway (rcp) for future
scenarios, and the type of biogeochemistry (bgc) model used. For example the
<filename>fatmgrid</filename> for the 1.9x2.5 resolution is as follows:
<screen width="99">
&lt;fatmgrid hgrid="1.9x2.5" &gt;lnd/clm2/griddata/griddata_1.9x2.5_060404.nc
&lt;/fatmgrid&gt;
</screen>
Other <filename>fatmgrid</filename> files are distinguished from this one by 
their resolution (hgrid) attribute.
</para>
<sect2 id="required_files">
<title>What are the required files?</title>
<para>
Different types of simulations and different types of configurations for CLM require
different lists of files. The Carbon Nitrogen (cn) Biogeochemistry model for example
requires <filename>fndepdat</filename> files, which are NOT required by other bgc modes.
Transient simulations also require transient datasets, and the names of these datasets
are sometimes different from the static versions (sometimes both are required as in
the dynamic PFT cases).
</para>
<para>
In the following table we list the different files used by CLM, they are listed
in order of importance, dependencies, and customizing. So the required files 
are all near the top, and the files used only under different conditions are listed
later, and files with the fewest dependencies are near the top, as are the files
that are least likely to be customized.
