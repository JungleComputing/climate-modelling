CAM tag used for the baseline comparison tests if different than previous
tag:

Summarize any changes to answers, i.e.,
- what code configurations:
- what platforms/compilers:
- nature of change (roundoff; larger than roundoff but same climate; new
  climate): 

If bitwise differences were observed, how did you show they were no worse
than roundoff?

If this tag changes climate describe the run(s) done to evaluate the new
climate in enough detail that it(they) could be reproduced, i.e.,
- source tag (all code used must be in the repository):
- platform/compilers:
- configure commandline:
- build-namelist command (or complete namelist):
- MSS location of output:

MSS location of control simulations used to validate new climate:

URL for AMWG diagnostics output used to validate new climate:
